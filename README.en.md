# Hi! I'm Magomed Gadzhiumarov 👋

### 🎓 MAI Student & 🛠️ Junior Engineer

I am a 2nd-year student at **Moscow Aviation Institute** (National Research University), majoring in **Informatics and Computer Engineering**. Alongside my studies, I work at **LLC "Component"** as a Junior Engineer.

My primary focus is system programming in C++ and exploring how technologies work "under the hood."

### 💻 Tech Stack

* **C++ (Core):** Deep dive into OOP, data structures, and algorithms.
* **Algorithms:** Experience in implementing graph algorithms (Dijkstra, A*), parallel computing (Parallel Boruvka), and Red-Black trees.
* **Web:** Understanding the basics of client-server interaction. Experience in building backend services using JavaScript (Node.js/Express) with database integration.
* **Low-level:** Foundational experience with WinAPI for creating GUIs and simple games.

### 🚀 Key Projects

#### [ConsoleChat](https://github.com/TankucT-AC/ConsoleChat) 💬
A personal pet project: a console-based chat application using WebSockets. Developed to study network protocols and asynchronous communication.

#### [CallOfDiddy (Coursework)](https://github.com/TankucT-AC/OOP_2_course/tree/main/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%87%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B5%20(CallOfDiddy)) 🎮
A 2D game built with pure C++ using Windows GDI/WinAPI. This project demonstrates my ability to handle game logic and system calls without relying on third-party engines.

#### [OOP_2_course](https://github.com/TankucT-AC/OOP_2_course) 📚
A repository featuring a solid algorithmic foundation, including:
* **Graph Algorithms:** Shortest path search (A*, Dijkstra) and custom `Graph` class implementations.
* **Parallel Computing:** Implementation of the Parallel Boruvka algorithm.
* **Data Structures:** Custom implementations of `RedBlackTree`, `LinkedList`, as well as various sorting and searching algorithms.

#### [WEB-technologies](https://github.com/TankucT-AC/WEB-tecnologies) 🌍
A university project (backend) — an information system dedicated to Dagestan's landmarks. This project helped me master the basics of Fullstack development and API integration.
